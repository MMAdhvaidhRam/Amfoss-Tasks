I get things done and i tend to learn more along the way. I love putting long hours into projects and i make sure that every single doubt of my is cleared. I think i will be valuable because i was THAT guy who did everything in the cs projects in school. Yes, im him.

## **How do you intend to contribute back to the club?**
I first intend to learn everything from the workshop to build a good understanding. I intend to participate in all events and discussions.  I will also try to represent amFOSS and Amrita vishwa vidya peetham.

## **What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?**

My field of interest lies in both electrical and computers, which explains why I ended up in my BTech branch. When it comes to computers, my interest lies in c, and GPUs. I want to deep dive into GPUs and learn more about it. I also like AI and will try to implement it in amFOSS projects. but I am eager to join AM@FOSS club because itâ€™s the only club I applied for and want to join so badly.
